My name is Wonchan Choi, an assistant professor at the [School of Information Studies](https://uwm.edu/informationstudies/) at the University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee (UWM). My areas of research involve information behavior and human–computer interaction. I received a PhD in information studies from the [School of Information](https://ischool.cci.fsu.edu/) at Florida State University. Before joining UWM in 2017, I worked as a postdoctoral fellow at the [Business School](https://www.wpi.edu/academics/business) at Worcester Polytechnic Institute in Massachusetts.
