I am an assistant professor at the School of Information Studies at the University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee (UWM). I completed a PhD in Information Studies at Florida State University. Prior to joining UWM, I worked as a postdoctoral fellow at the Business School at Worcester Polytechnic Institute in Massachusetts.

I am broadly interested in human information behavior and human–computer interaction. My current projects focus on:
- Information credibility evaluation on interactive knowledge production platforms
- Usability and accessibility of information systems for diverse users

The best method to contact me is via email (wchoi@uwm.edu). Here's my [Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=p5_1GbgAAAAJ&hl=en) profile page.
