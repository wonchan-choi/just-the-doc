# Current Projects
The University of Wisconsin Milwaukee School of Information Studies will create mobile digital library accessibility and usability guidelines to support blind and visually impaired users. This project will generate a new framework including a theoretical approach that considers all usersâ€™ needs; types of help-seeking situations blind and visually impaired users encounter using mobile digital libraries; limitations of the existing mobile digital library guidelines; mobile digital library accessibility and usability guidelines addressing each situation; current digital libraries compliance status; and methodology to be applied to develop guidelines supporting other underserved groups. The project will help policymakers, researchers, and practitioners understand digital library design problems and enable developers to enhance digital libraries for universal access.
